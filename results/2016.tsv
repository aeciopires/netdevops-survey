It would be useful to gain some insight from the community around API usage, what works, what doesn't, what's widely adopted in production, etc. Sure some of the tools mentioned in this form (like NAPALM) rely on some of these APIs (when possible), but getting direct feedback from the community around the kind of automation that is built nowadays around more modern APIs available on various vendor gear would be useful. The emergence of APIs in vendor gear is a key part of enabling ""infrastructure as code"", IMO, because before that we were left to screen scraping and SNMP bullshit."
